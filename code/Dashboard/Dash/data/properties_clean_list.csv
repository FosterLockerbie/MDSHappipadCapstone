480,Clean bedroom with family in Glenrosa.  Perfect for students.,"Lake view house built in 2018.  3 of our kids have left for University and now we have an extra bedroom that is perfect for a student looking for accommodations.  We travel with our RV most weekends or are out on our boat in the summer.  We don’t mind providing some meals during the week.  We have 2 dogs that are very cuddly and friendly.  We have a room with 3 Xbox’s that are linked, hardly ever use this space so it would make a great place for you to chill and have some privacy.  There is also a desk in that room for studying or doing school work.  The picture of the bedroom furnished with a couch and exercise bike is the room that is for rent.

About Me: 

I am 41-year-old male who teaches in Victoria School District 61. I have been teaching overseas for the past 20 years and have returned to Victoria last year. I am very easy going, respectful of peoples’ space and privacy.  I drink socially, love the outdoors and live a very active lifestyle biking, swimming and hiking.

Quiet/Study time/Friends:
You will definitely have enough quiet time/private time for yourself because our roommates study/work a lot, and sometimes you will be all alone in the house. We do not allow any drinking parties in this house. Quiet wine parties/dinners are fine as long as you are respectful towards other tenants.This is a house for professionals/serious students.

 

Parking:
We have a designated parking area. Additionally, plenty of parking on the street.

for students and professionals. Relatively close to University of Calgary, SAIT and Foothills Hospital.

-Northland Mall is 2 minutes away (the house is very close to it)
-John Laurie Blvd/Nosehill Park is 1 min away.

646,BR FOR RENT ON ACREAGE 5MIN DRIVE TO CALGARY NE. ALL INCLUSIVE!,"Hello. Thanks for visiting my posting.


HOUSE AREA AND LOCATION

This large house (~2700 sq ft) sits on a huge acreage (20 acre), from which 4 acre belong to this property. It is a bi-level located 5 minute further east than Stoney Trail NE @ Country Hills Blvd NE intersection, close to Skyview and Cornerstone communities. The bedroom available for rent is located in the upper lever but there will be more rooms available downstairs soon. Please note that there is No Public Transit coming to the property. Some pics were taken in the summer; some other in the wintertime.


INSIDE THE HOUSE

There are 2 washrooms and 2 kitchens in the house: 1 washroom and 1 kitchen per level. There is a nice deck and sunroom. I believe it is easier for male individuals to share this house, as females may find it difficult to meet their privacy needs (there is 2 washrooms only, and willing to be 6 persons at the house once basement is repaired). Parking is immense on the acreage but we have parking rules so that the house looks spacious and beautiful. You may set up a shelter for your vehicle after we agree upon a convenient spot.


SOME RULES

This is a non-smoking house. No RVs allowed. We don't allow overnight visits. No pets allowed. Shared areas are to be kept clean (without OCD). One person per room only: sorry, no couples.


INSIDE THE BEDROOM AND UTILITIES

There is a flat screen TV in each bedroom with Chrome Cast. It can be furnished or you can bring your own furnitures; either works. All utilities included and very fast internet, too. You won't pay extra for water, heating, electricity, gas, garbage service, or internet... Except if you use more utilities than a normal person, or dispose more garbage than our average [we have our monthly records so we know our use].


PERSONS AT THE HOUSE

The basement is under repair but once finished, we will be 6 persons at the house, including my wife and myself. Only working people are allowed. Quiet hours between 11pm and 7am. My wife and I (28yo) sell furniture and are in and out all day almost every day. I spend around 8 days in Edmonton per month. The house feels spacious, as most people go to work or have fun outdoors.


OUR ROOMMATE MUST:

*Rent a room by him or herself (no couples)

*Be flexible

*Be adaptable

*Like it tidy and clean without having OCD

*Have a normal amount of stuff (no hoarders)

*Be able to communicate in fluent English, Spanish, Czech, Polish, or French

*Be experienced sharing a house with other people

*Be ok with sharing meals and drinks occasionally

*Appreciate and promote other persons' privacy

*Be young-spirited, regardless of age.

*Have a very good attitude towards life and bring good vibe to the house

*Have a car and a valid driver's license

*Respect for social rules

*Be a follower of society as is [no independent/alternative thinkers allowed]

*Have a good credit score, which demonstrates you like to follow social rules the same way we do.

715,Private living room in 1 bedroom apartment,"Hi! 

About the place

The place is a 1 bedroom flat, i live in the main bedroom and i am renting the living room. The living room has curtains so you have full privacy(also looking into getting doors installed). It also has a big sofa, TV, desk and cupboards for your clothes. (note: bed is not included but i do have a queen blowup you can use)
The building has a huge storage space for your belongings (i dont need it) and it also has a place to store bycicles and a washer/dryer. Rent includes all utilities and bills.

About the area

The location is very central, walking distance to everything in Vancouver and close to bus-stops which can take you to skytrain. We are close to Stanley Park and the beaches so in the Summer it is very convenient and a nice way to spend the day / evening after work.

About me

I am a 29 year old guy from London (England), i work in IT for Lululemon Mon-Fri and sometimes on the weekend.I am a quiet person, clean and outgoing but i also like to spend time and relax in my room. I go to the gym 4-5 times per week, and i study japanese but i am a beginner, so having someone in the house that can speak japanese might help me to improve mine.

Availability

My roommate leaves september 13th, so its available from then or from October 1st - i'm happy to show around whenever.

Thank you!

*Note pictures were taken before current roommate, bed in picture is no longer here. Also curtains are much longer so no gaps at the bottom.

p.s. No couples allowed

727,Private bedroom and shared bathroom and laundry,"Upper 3 bedroom suite in a 7 bedroom home.  The downstairs is rented out separately and my husband and I rent the upstairs portion of the home.  We do connect with our downstairs neighbours and have games nights and visit sometimes. 

My husband and I are a newly married couple in our early 30s.  My husband works for Kelowna Ready Mix as a concrete mixer driver and crane operator and I contract work and study at Okanagan College.  We enjoy the outdoors and community.  Our home typically has some kind of company over at least once a week at the moment enjoying games, my husbands cooking or just visiting.  My husband really enjoys cooking meat treats and other goodies on his Traeger BBQ smoker.

There are bus stops, Okanagan College, Kelowna General Hospital, grocery shopping, beach and restaurants within walking distance of our rental.  Our landlords are very kind and laid back and we have a good relationship with them.  The home has parking, a large shared back yard, shared laundry, large shared kitchen and private bedroom and guest bedroom for our friends and family when/if they visit.  The downstairs unit only shares the back yard and internet with us.

We are looking for someone good with people being around and is okay being independent.  My husband and I have fairly active and busy lives.  Introverts work great too as your room will always be your private space.

This room is only available Jan 1 to May 1, 2022.  We are looking to extend our lease with our landlords and if they allows the extension then we would be open to a guest extension to May 31.  We will not know this until the new year.

Roommates are responsible for their own groceries, laundry detergent and extras.

Roommates will be responsible to helping clean the shared space.  We can discuss what this would look like as well as other details in a phone interview if this looks like it could be a good host/guest match.",Kelowna,BC,V1Y 5C1,,,1,704.0,96.0,864.0,2022-03-01,draft,House,,,,,"['Dish Detergent', 'Toilet Paper']",,,"['Bedding', 'Blankets', 'Towels', 'Pillows', 'Desk', 'Hangers', 'Closet']",Single bed,['Smoke Detector'],"['Free parking on site', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Dishwasher', 'Microwave', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioner', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Tv', 'Window covering', 'Kitchenware']","['No smoking', 'No shoes inside', 'Keep spaces clean', 'Notice on visitors', ""Policy on visitor's stay""]",,,Kelowna
728,Beautiful House with Lovely People,"Our home is a gorgeous two story attached garage with all the amenities! It is a 2200 sq.ft. home with four bed rooms and 2.5 bathrooms. You enter this beautiful home, welcomed by a spacious and inviting foyer with 25 foot ceilings. The kitchen and living room are very inviting and comfortable areas, where one can relax after a long day. The kitchen will be a place were it will be a pleasure to prepare a delicious home cooked meal. Granite counter tops and hardwood cabinets, along with stainless steal appliances make this kitchen a great and convenient place to prepare your food. This home also features a great amount of storage areas that include the kitchen pantry, wet room to the garage, downstairs basement and the garage itself. The open concept to the dining room and living room, give the main floor a feeling of endless room. If dining inside is not enough, how about a meal on the adjacent deck, whether you can devour your home cooked meal on the comfortable patio furniture enjoying the crisp fresh air. After your wonderful meal relax in the living room and watch some TV or that movie you have been dying to see. After a long day you have the option of retreating to the bonus room upstairs or your own room for greater privacy. Some other conveniences in the upstairs, include a separate bathroom with granite and hardwood cabinetry and a deep tub, where you can relax and refresh. Also, very conveniently placed is the upstairs laundry room with a modern washer and dyer. No more going up and down two flights of stairs to the basement to do your laundry! 

Not only are you choosing a beautiful and comfortable place to live, but one that is very convenient to a lot of amenities. There are numerous walk ways and parks around the area including a dog park if you have a fury friend! Yes pets are welcomed! Shopping is also very accessible, with groceries stores, restaurants, movie theaters,  and other shops only minutes away! The residential area also has great access to major freeways that give you access to the all of Edmonton, the international airport and surrounding municipalities. This community also allows quick access to escape the hassle-and-bustle of city life,  if you wanted to take off for the weekend to Calgary, Banff, or Jasper. 

This home definitely has a lot to offer, but most importantly, is that you will be welcomed by very loving and accommodating people. We are individuals that have a passion for people and building long-lasting relationships! You are not only finding a place to live, but you are also finding a place to call home, where you are not seen as a tenant, but as a member of the family!

Stanley Park. My place includes wifi and cable tv, and has laundry in the building and a locked bike-room in the basement. 

You'll share with me only, and have the option of sharing meals (ideal if you don't like cooking, too busy working or studying, or simply prefer to not deal with meal planning and grocery shopping!).  

Looking for an easygoing, tidy roomie. Would be perfect for a student or someone travelling! The perfect roommate would not need to be fastidious about cleaning but be organized and someone that always cleans up after themselves as I am the same way.

At this time am preferring a roomie that will stay until February 2022 at least, possibly until the end of the school year. Feel free to reach out though and we can discuss.

Please note:
If you have a vehicle you will need to purchase a West End parking pass in order to park in the area. I do not have a parking spot within the building unfortunately.

958,Private bedroom and shared bathroom and laundry (2),"Upper 3 bedroom suite in a 7 bedroom home.  The downstairs is rented out separately and my husband and I rent the upstairs portion of the home.  We do connect with our downstairs neighbours and have games nights and visit sometimes. 

My husband and I are a newly married couple in our early 30s.  My husband works for Kelowna Ready Mix as a concrete mixer driver and crane operator and I contract work and study at Okanagan College.  We enjoy the outdoors and community.  Our home typically has some kind of company over at least once a week at the moment enjoying games, my husbands cooking or just visiting.  My husband really enjoys cooking meat treats and other goodies on his Traeger BBQ smoker.

There are bus stops, Okanagan College, Kelowna General Hospital, grocery shopping, beach and restaurants within walking distance of our rental.  Our landlords are very kind and laid back and we have a good relationship with them.  The home has parking, a large shared back yard, shared laundry, large shared kitchen and private bedroom and guest bedroom for our friends and family when/if they visit.  The downstairs unit only shares the back yard and internet with us.

We are looking for someone good with people being around and is okay being independent.  My husband and I have fairly active and busy lives.  Introverts work great too as your room will always be your private space.

This room is only available Jan 1 to May 1, 2022.  We are looking to extend our lease with our landlords and if they allows the extension then we would be open to a guest extension to May 31.  We will not know this until the new year.

Roommates are responsible for their own groceries, laundry detergent and extras.

Roommates will be responsible to helping clean the shared space.  We can discuss what this would look like as well as other details in a phone interview if this looks like it could be a good host/guest match.",Kelowna,BC,V1Y 5C1,,,1,682.0,93.0,837.0,2022-01-04,draft,House,,,,,"['Dish Detergent', 'Toilet Paper']",,,"['Bedding', 'Blankets', 'Towels', 'Pillows', 'Desk', 'Hangers', 'Closet']",Single bed,['Smoke Detector'],"['Free parking on site', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Dishwasher', 'Microwave', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioner', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Tv', 'Window covering', 'Kitchenware']","['No smoking', 'No shoes inside', 'Keep spaces clean', 'Notice on visitors', ""Policy on visitor's stay""]",,,Kelowna

1063,1 bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment in Rosedale,"OFFERING: 1 bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment. Shared kitchen and bathroom space.

TERM: Short Term (Available April 1st to June 30th)

RENT: $759 per month (Price will not increase for the term available) + $45 for Internet 

LOCATION: Rosedale (15 minute bus ride from Rosedale Station) 

LEVEL: Second Floor - Lots of Light!

UTILITIES: All utilities are included except Internet and Air Conditioning. AC units have to be bought and installed in the summer. My current internet plan is approximately $90 per month, but I’m looking into getting a cheaper one. Coin laundry is in the basement.

RELATIONSHIP TO UNIT: I am the Leaseholder of the unit. Rent will be paid to me and then forwarded to the landlord.

ACCESSIBILITY: Unfortunately the apartment is not wheelchair accessible. To enter the unit, you must be able to walk up two flights of stairs. The apartment has a sound smoke alarm with a carbon monoxide detector.

SCENT: I have no issues regarding scents. As per the landlord’s rules, smoking is only allowed outside of the premises. 

REQUIRED DOCUMENTS: My landlord requires you to fill out a Tenant Application form so that they have your basic info (i.e. Phone Number, Email, etc), should you decide to move in. 

ADDITIONAL INFO: The apartment is right next to a train track, so anyone who is bothered by loud noises might want to look elsewhere. However, there are lots of great parks and green spaces nearby (Evergreen Brickworks is a 10-minute walk away). There is also a grocery store right next to the apartment. 

ABOUT ME (QUEER SAFETY and SELF-IDENTITY): Hello! My name is Calyx Passailaigue. I am a non-binary filmmaker and actor based out of Toronto. My pronouns are They/Them. I love watching great movies, going out to a nice dinner with friends, and playing video games to unwind. I LOVE TO LAUGH and deeply value having a good sense of humour, especially in the face of hardships.

Although anyone is welcome to apply, I would love to find a fellow member of the Queer, Trans, and/or ENBY communities to live with. In turn, I will ensure that the apartment remains an LGBTQ+ inclusive, sex-positive, and emotionally supportive living space, while at the same time respecting boundaries. Please feel free to speak to me about any specific concerns you may have during the application process. I am happy to answer any questions!

Additionally, I am looking for a respectful, positive roommate who will stay on top of cleaning up after themselves (i.e. do your own dishes, keep the shared spaces relatively clean, etc). I ask that we limit the number of guests in the apartment while the COVID situation develops. As long as we respect each other’s boundaries, privacy, and mental well-being, I’m sure we will get along wonderfully!

CONTACT: Please send all inquiries to calyxapartment2022@gmail.com.

The bath is a full tub/shower combo.  The upstairs if full furnished to share with TV/cable and internet.   Parking is located on the driveway or in garage when owner is away.   

The area is very family oriented and quiet.  It's in a suburban area and so a car is a must as  public transport is patchy.    The home is occupied by myself and my son (13) but we  spend much time away and it's a very large home so plenty of space.

We prefer shorter term tenants but can potentially accommodate requests for certain circumstances.    You'll definitely need a car for this location.",Kelowna,BC,V1W 5G4,,,1,850.0,100.0,1026.0,2022-08-15,listed,House,,,,,"['Pantry Items', 'Condiments', 'Dish Detergent']",,,"['Bedding', 'Closet']",Queen bed,"['Smoke Detector', 'Carbon Monoxide Detector']","['Free parking on site', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Dishwasher', 'Microwave', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioner', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Cable / Satellite', 'Tv', 'Window covering', 'Kitchenware']","['No smoking', 'Notice on visitors', ""Policy on visitor's stay""]",,,Kelowna

1378,Nice & bright bedroom w. private bathroom by Okanagan College,"Available October 1st or 15th. 

Renting out my spare bedroom in my cozy condo right across from Okanagan College. Seeking a female student or young professional.

The condo is located on the top floor of the building facing south (lots of sun to enjoy on the covered balcony) and has a split floor plan. This is a quiet 19+ building in a Cul-de-Sac.

The bedroom is approximately 11 x 9 ft, has a spacious closet, blackout curtains and is furnished with a double bed with a super comfortable mattress, desk, chair and nightstand. I’d be happy to purchase a dresser as well for extra storage. You will have your own bathroom with a shower. The bathroom has a brand new vanity, toilet, flooring and fresh paint (hardware and mirror will be installed this week, and I will update with new photos then. Vanity, toilet and flooring are the same as in the other bathroom pictures). The kitchen, living room with electric fireplace and laundry (washer and dryer in the unit) will be shared. The balcony has a small BBQ, table and chairs. The unit also has a small pantry.

The rent includes all utilities (heat, electricity, hot water and Wifi). Minimum 8 months lease but 1-year preferred. Half a month’s rent damage deposit is required. 

I am a quiet professional and like spending time in the great outdoors, preferably in the mountains, hiking in the summer, and snowshoeing in the winter.  I also enjoy reading, cooking or watching a movie curled up on the couch. No parties, no smoking or drugs, no drama. Single occupancy only.

Must love cats as the space is also shared with my sweet but sometimes a little crazy rescue kitty Tiger.

Great location, right across from the college and bus stops and only minutes away from grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, yoga studios and Gyro Beach. Sorry, there is no designated parking spot that comes with the room, so it will be perfect for someone who either doesn‘t have a vehicle or does not need to use their car daily (there is only very limited street parking available).

References and proof of school and/or work will be required.",Kelowna,BC,V1W 3W1,,,1,850.0,50.0,972.0,2022-10-01,listed,Apartment,,,,"['Storage locker', 'Elevator']",['Dish Detergent'],,,"['Bedding', 'Blankets', 'Pillows', 'Desk', 'Hangers', 'Closet', 'Lamp']",Double bed,"['Smoke Detector', 'First aid kit']","['Street parking', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Dishwasher', 'Microwave', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'Air conditioner', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Window covering', 'Kitchenware']","['No smoking', 'Quiet hours', 'Keep spaces clean', ""Policy on visitor's stay"", 'Scent free']",,,Kelowna

The house is equipped with central AC and gas heating, as well as 2 full bathrooms, a dishwasher, on-street parking and in-unit laundry. 

Included in the room is a queen sized bed, side table, wardrobe, desk and chair. You will have your own pantry and fridge space. The room is 13x14 feet. 

The house is very close to the UBCO bus route (about a 35 minute commute), and as stated earlier is very close to almost any amenity you might need. 

The living space is shared with 3rd year UBCO students (male and female) in their early 20's who are all easy going people. We have all been friends for 3+ years and get along very well together and with others. We would love if our new roommate could integrate well into our friend group but if they would prefer to spend the majority of their time alone or apart from the rest of the roommates, that would be absolutely fine. 

Common hobbies among the roommates are playing chess and other board games, puzzles, watching hockey, and going downtown for drinks. We like to have groups of friends over every so often and these social gatherings can range from 3 to 15 friends at a time.

There is no pets or indoor smoking allowed, and the room is single occupancy only. Rent is $750 a month and utilities are an extra $65 a month.

1638,Bright and quiet basement bedroom,"Although this room is in the basement, it is large, bright and comfortable. (I know, I sometimes sleep there in the summertime!)

The neighbourhood is very quiet. The only noise emanates from my washer and dryer (which I wouldn't be running at night) and my composter (which is very cool but can be noisy--we'd have to discuss!).

My place is walking distance to downtown, about 15 minutes to the grocery stores and 20 or so to the rest of the main street shops. It is one long block from Alexis Park Drive where there is regular bus service.

1834,"Clean, sunny bedroom in a shared house with a cool chick and her cool dog","Hi! 
I am renting a good-size bedroom in my home. The room gets lots of nice sunshine throughout the day. The house is a small (~1200 sq ft) townhouse. Two stories. 1.5 bathrooms. Shared kitchen and living space downstairs. Small but nice fenced yard with garden and leisure space. Lots of recreational space on the larger common property (about 7 acres total). Bedroom is unfurnished - but I could furnish it with the basics if that's the preference of interested tenants.

I have a medium-sized bully mix who is very friendly but will need boundaries from you, or will try and sleep in your bed every night. I occasionally need a dog-sitter - if you'd be willing to do this, I would compensate/reduce rent :)

Utilities include hydro and internet. If you need parking, there is an extra fee required by the strata. $10 for a field spot or $20 for a paved spot - subject to availability. We are super close to the hospital and within walking distance to downtown Duncan and all amenities. 

Generally, I am looking for temporary or short-term renters more than long-term, but for the right folks, I can be flexible! Food sharing and all those bits will be worked out case-by-case, depending on how we want to live together :)

Full transparency, the house is old and imperfect and I am still working thru a couple of renos. Everything is perfectly functional! But at times a bit ugly.

1931,Cottage in the North End,"Furnished room for rent with a quiet, self-employed, vegan woman, a snuggly, mellow cat, and one other roommate. There are two bedrooms available. I'm looking for one person per room, or a couple could rent both rooms and have the whole upstairs to themselves, with their own bathroom. 

This house has lots of character. One friend said it was like the set of Little Women. The spacious bedrooms have sloped ceilings and dormer windows. The flooring is the original wide-plank wood from 1869

I'm looking for someone quiet, eco-conscious, and on a vegetarian or plant-based diet. I'm a 'granola' person. I use natural cleaning products, and can't tolerate strong artificial fragrances. I burn incense occasionally, but it's not a necessity. 

There's a wood stove in the kitchen, which is nice and cozy in the winter, and there is electric heat in the rooms, but I prefer to heat with wood, so the ideal tenant has experience using a woodstove and prefers wood heat as well, understanding the labour that goes into it. (Splitting and stacking will already be done.) 

The room will have a bed, armchair and dresser, and other furniture is up for discussion. I could add a desk or table if you like. There are two rooms for rent, one with a Queen bed, and the other with a double. 

I've converted the living room of this house into my own bedroom and home office, so it is not shared, but there is a loveseat in front of the woodstove in the kitchen. This place isn't great for parties, but each bedroom has space for an armchair and/or desk, or maybe even a small loveseat. 

 I also have my own bathroom downstairs, so the upstairs bathroom will only be shared by upstairs tenants people. 

The kitchen has everything you'll need to make a gourmet meal - cast iron pans, vitamix, food processor, Instant pot, aor fryer, etc. even a dehydrator. I don't cook often, but I love to share meals and I make a great sous-chef. 

There is a big backyard with a deck, and a fire pit. When the weather is good, I like hosting pizza parties outside. There's also a tiny house on a trailer in the backyard, and the resident shares the yard.

The $100 for utilities includes water, firewood, and internet. Electricity will be an additional fee based on usage and split among residents. Preference will be given to those with experience & enthusiasm for woodstoves.",Halifax,NS,B3K 1N4,,,1,850.0,100.0,950.0,,draft,House,,,,,"['Pantry Items', 'Condiments', 'Dish Detergent', 'Toilet Paper']",,,"['Bedding', 'Blankets', 'Towels', 'Pillows', 'Desk', 'Hangers', 'Drawers', 'Lamp']",Double bed,"['Fire Extinguisher', 'Smoke Detector', 'Carbon Monoxide Detector']","['Street parking', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Microwave', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Fenced yard', 'Blow dryer', 'Kitchenware']","['No smoking', 'No shoes inside', ""Policy on visitor's stay""]",,,Halifax

Facility has a gym on the property. On direct frequent bus routes. Located downtown. Close to hiking at Knox. Plenty of time at many beaches to choose from with in a few blocks distance. Cycling routes convenient around town. A parking pass with a monthly fee can be arranged if needed. 

6 months or longer is preferred for a term. It is a legal occupancy I would be offering. My Property Manager has a screening process required for approval. It is an application form which will result in a credit and background check. References required. 

There is a very sweet cat in the suite. She has a strict diet requirement so it is imperative to not feed her treats . She has been a costly one for vets due to the slightest change in diet. This is something very important to understand a strict boundary on. You can cuddle her all you want though if you'd like :) She is well behaved. I keep her litter tidy and cleaned daily. Scrubbed down every few days. 

I am up early for my routine before an early start at my job. I have a fixed schedule. I mostly just snack after work so I'm not cooking often week nights. My cooking I keep for meal prep and my days off. 

a few days a week, I work out from home. You have permission to use my stuff I have in the suite. All I ask is put it back where you found it. There is a gym that has hours available. week days 6:30 am to 9 pm- weekends 9 to 9.

The house is kept tidy and clean. There is a dish washer. I expect an occupant to have same cleanliness preferences as myself. Im sure if you're not tidy, being nagged sucks. And as someone who is more tidy, I'm sure know its a pain to nag. With that said, its a fit or its not. If you know its not, please save the headache and pass on this occupancy.  

Now that I have mentioned the order I keep the place, I ask some help be done time to time. Such  to sweep up after cooking or wipe up a spill. Keeping dishes rinsed and put in the dishwasher when done. If notice something is low, make a note or replace it. Garbage full? take it out. Notice the soaps down? grab one on the way home. The usual house keeping things. I clean daily so chances you'll have more than yourself to tidy after is slim.

2141,Spacious room in North End Halifax,"Furnished room for rent with a quiet, self-employed, plant-based woman, a snuggly, mellow cat, and one other roommate. 

This house has lots of character. One friend said it was like the set of Little Women. The spacious bedrooms have sloped ceilings and dormer windows. The flooring is the original wide-plank wood from 1869

I'm looking for someone quiet, eco-conscious, and on a vegetarian or plant-based diet. I'm a 'granola' person. I use natural cleaning products, and can't tolerate strong artificial fragrances. I burn incense occasionally, but it's not a necessity. 

There's a wood stove in the kitchen, which is nice and cozy in the winter, and there is electric heat in the rooms, but I prefer to heat with wood, so the ideal tenant has experience using a woodstove and prefers wood heat as well, understanding the labour that goes into it. (Splitting and stacking will already be done.) 

The room will have a bed, armchair and dresser, and other furniture is up for discussion. I could add a desk or table if you like. This room has a Queen bed.

I've converted the living room of this house into my own bedroom and home office, so it is not shared, but there is a loveseat in front of the woodstove in the kitchen. This place isn't great for parties, but each bedroom has space for an armchair and/or desk, or maybe even a small loveseat. 

 I also have my own bathroom downstairs, so the upstairs bathroom will only be shared by upstairs tenants people. 

The kitchen has everything you'll need to make a gourmet meal - cast iron pans, vitamix, food processor, Instant pot, aor fryer, etc. even a dehydrator. I don't cook often, but I love to share meals and I make a great sous-chef. 

There is a big backyard with a deck, and a fire pit. When the weather is good, I like hosting pizza parties outside. There's also a tiny house on a trailer in the backyard, and the resident shares the yard.

The $100 for utilities includes water, firewood, and internet. Electricity will be an additional fee based on usage and split among residents. Preference will be given to those with experience & enthusiasm for woodstoves.",Halifax,NS,B3K 1N4,,,1,950.0,100.0,1050.0,,draft,Townhouse,,,,,"['Pantry Items', 'Condiments', 'Dish Detergent', 'Toilet Paper']",,,"['Bedding', 'Blankets', 'Towels', 'Pillows', 'Desk', 'Drawers', 'Lamp']",Queen bed,"['Fire Extinguisher', 'Smoke Detector', 'Carbon Monoxide Detector', 'First aid kit']","['Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Microwave', 'Fireplace', 'wifi', 'Fenced yard', 'Blow dryer', 'Kitchenware', 'Blow dryer']","['No smoking', 'No shoes inside', 'Keep spaces clean']",,,Halifax

2312,Master Bedroom Ensuite Bath & patio access with Lake view,"ROOMMATES WANTED

I am seeking one or two like-hearted people to share a Peachland log home. The property has 6 bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms. I have two dogs (a 4 year old border colllie/lab x and a 2 year old majestic treehound, which is a coonhound/blood hound x). Any roommates would need to be OK with dogs. The property has a stunning lake view, two decks, an outdoor fire pit, interior wood burning stove, a hot tub, and an extensive library of metaphysical books. There is parking for one vehicle per person and the property is situated near a winery, forest hiking, Okanagan Lake, and bus routes. The private, fenced back yard needs some love and attention, but has established fruit trees and extensive garden opportunities. The backyard is surrounded by forest and offers privacy. 

I am a professional in my mid 40s that works partly from home and lives a peaceful, spiritual lifestyle. If you think this might be a fit for you please direct message me for more information. The ask would be $900 per month plus a share of utilities. Potentially less for someone willing to pitch in with gardening, yard work and/or home renovations. 

Although I would otherwise welcome people to have a dog or other pets, as I love animals, I have one dog that does not typically interact well with other animals that are in the home or on the property.

A few important notes:
If you are interested, an application will need to be filled out and approved by my building manager prior to the move in date. Also, the room will NOT include any of the furniture. The person living here now will be taking the bed etc. They may also be taking the couch. The bedroom and bathroom with be cleared out for any furniture you may need to move in. 
The photos include a pole in the living room. This is something I do for fitness. It can be taken down occasionally, but finding a roommate who is accepting of or even interested in this hobby is important to me :)

DETAILS ON LOCATION
This wee home is 20 minutes from Halifax in Upper Tantallon. It is partially furnished and features a fabulous kitchen with 7 appliances (including laundry), a private deck, dedicated parking, winter snow removal, and an unheated storage space (can fit a bike and up to 8 large tote bins or boxes but isn’t suitable for excess furniture). Within 0.5 to 2 km are two large grocery stores, banking, pharmacies, hardware stores, restaurants, doctor’s offices, haircuts, public library, community centre, and a Metro Link terminal (for access to the rest of HRM). Right next door to the property is the Shambhala Centre where you can practice meditation if you’d like!

YOU & YOUR NEIGHBOURS (us!)
This space is best suited to one tenant who is a non-smoker. Our family is composed of two moms and a 9-year old daughter so we would enjoy having a tenant who is part of the 2SLGBTQIA+ community or an ally. One of us is an elementary school teacher and the other works from home. Sharing our property means that we will respect your privacy and we’ll expect the same in return. We are good neighbours and we will be renting this space to someone we feel will be a good neighbour too. 

SUITE DETAILS   
The bedroom area fits a queen sized bed (bed frame can be provided but mattress is not). Other included furnishings are a bedside table, an armoire (with closet rod and drawers), a large overhead shelf with baskets, dining table, two stools, a large comfy chair, and a small storage ottoman.

The kitchen includes dishwasher, clothes washer/dryer combo, cooktop, very cool fridge (!!), range hood, countertop oven/air fryer, Keurig, and all the cooking/eating items you’ll need.

The living area features a cozy reading nook and a work/dining area. The bathroom has a generous glassed-in shower and effective storage space. 

With lots of light, including a 6-foot patio door, this space features your own private entrance (on the opposite side of the property to our home), a deck, patio furniture, a BBQ (for summer/fall/spring), a small yard area, and your own parking spot. Snow removal from the driveway and lawn care are provided. A shovel is provided so you can clear your deck and walkway in winter. 

ACCESSIBILITY
There are two steps up to access the space. Once inside, it is all on one level with no barrier between the living area and bathroom. There are no grab bars in the bathroom and the shower has a 1” curb.

RENTAL TERM
This little home is available from Sep 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025 (renewal for Sep 2025 is possible but summer months are not open).

If I'm living here I will continue to have the alarm system monitored.)

The lawn is mowed every two weeks and snow is removed from driveway and walk-ways, within 24 hours of snow fall ending.

There are no neighbors at all so very quiet and very private. There is a large empty lot next to the house that I also own, which you can use for parking.

2790,Shared house in North End Halifax,"Seeking a roommate for September 1st 2024 to share my large light-filled house in the vibrant North End of Halifax.

I am looking to share my beautiful home with a lovely person. Ideally I would like to live with one person who occupies two rooms ( I am open to a single parent with shared custody. I enjoy children.) We would share the dining room, living room, two bathrooms, laundry, beautiful kitchen and a charming garden with a large patio. Heat & water included, we would split the cost of power and internet.  $1800 One-year lease. I am open to renting the rooms out to two separate people. Larger bed room with large closet and ensuite access to shared bath would be $1100 and smaller bed room would be $900. 

Looking for a non-smoker, responsible person, and good communicator who wants to live with others. Sorry no pets. 

I am a 54 year artist and mother of two grown children. I am excited to begin this adventure of sharing my home with someone new.

2828,"Bedroom and small office/workspace in North End Halifax, Walkable to Dal and Hospitals","For Rent: 
A bedroom with queen bed and closet, and small, separate office/workspace in my shared two-bedroom house, perfect for a graduate student, post-doc, or medical resident. Both rooms have east-facing windows out to the street (a dead-end laneway with plenty of pedestrian traffic).

My home is a 100+ year old townhouse in the North End near the Commons. The house is located just off of Agricola Street, walking distance to bars, restaurants, shops, and cafés. It is an approximately 15 minute walk to Dalhousie University and the hospitals, 10 minute walk to restaurants and clubs on Gottigen Street, a 12-15 minute bike ride to SMU campus, 15 minutes walk to Halifax Central Library, and just a couple minutes' walk to the Commons, The Oval, and the public pool. 

*Utilities included in rental cost: water, power, wifi, and streaming channels on the living room television (you are welcome to add your own subscriptions to the TV if you wish). 
*Street parking only. 
*Bedding, pillows, towels can be provided
*Share kitchen/pantry staples (salt/pepper/condiments/cooking oils), but responsible for purchasing own groceries and rotating out leftovers and unused food promptly.
*Cleaning supplies, dish soap, laundry detergent provided
*Washer and Dryer in house
*Shared full bathroom and shared 1/2 bath on first floor. 
*Shared kitchen (with caveats about certain cookware/kitchen items)
*Omnivorous house: I cook/eat meat, fish, poultry, eggs, grains, and lots of vegetables, and I also often ferment things like batches of kimchi.
*Ground floor of house is ""open concept,"" with living room, dining room, back room (my work space) and 1/2 bathroom. The dining ""room"" has a large dining table, and the living room area has two comfy couches and a Roku TV.

About me: a middle-aged trans/queer positive (and you should be, too) man with two dogs and a beehive. I mostly work from home as a writer, freelance editor, and part-time instructor. I garden in the tiny back yard and care for the growing collection of houseplants. I enjoy cooking and sharing food. I am friendly and caring, but need my privacy and respect yours. I prefer less conversation when I first wake up--it's not personal, I just need coffee. :) This is my home and it is important to me that anyone sharing it treats the house, me, and the dogs with care, kindness, and respect. 

The ideal renter will be:
*LGBTQ positive and/or identified: no homophobia, transphobia, racism in my house.
*a mature, responsible, clear and direct communicator
*Employed and busy with studies, activities, etc.  
*Non-smoker/non-vaper --no smoking or vaping of anything, tobacco, cannabis, whatever is allowed in the house (I don't care if you partake outside of the house, I just cannot tolerate the smell of cannabis flower or smoke, tobacco smoke, or vape smells inside or directly outside of my home.
*Not a habitual/addicted substance user (I am a very light, casual consumer of alcohol in the house, < 1-3 drinks per week, if that; a heavy drinker or substance user will not be a good fit).
*No parties or frequent over-night guests 
*No ""subletters""
*Mindful of security, keeping the house locked up and not letting dogs out the front door. 
*A dog-lover, and excited to live with pups, but not a pet owner yourself (no more pets allowed).

*Able to keep reasonably quiet in the house between 10 pm -7 am. 
*Enjoy the small deck and backyard outdoor space

2831,Private Room for Rent,"I am looking for a room mate to come live in the centrally located apartment that I live in. A 5 minute drive to downtown or Orchard Park Mall, and it is also a 5 minute walk to stops on the #10 bus route that goes downtown and to Orchard Park Mall. There is a partially furnished 12.5' x 11' 10"" bedroom and a bathroom right outside the bed room that would be shared with another room mate, an in suite washer and dryer, a fridge and freezer, a dishwasher, and an oven, stove and microwave. There is also storage space. The rent is $1050 per month, plus internet monthly and utilities bi-monthly. The room will include a set of drawers, a dresser, a desk chair, and a twin size bed. You will also be required to pay a $525 damage deposit. There is also a large patio that one can enjoy most of the year. The room will be available on March 1st.

What I'm looking for: A reliable person preferably in the 25-35 age range, who pays their rent and bills on time, is respectful of the boundaries and the belongings of the people they live with, is clean, friendly and smoke and drug free (including weed). I would prefer someone who doesn't have a pet, but if you do, I would consider it depending on the pet, however you would be required to pay a pet deposit of $525.

About me: I am a 31 year old man who is a working professional in the museum and heritage industry full time and I also work a part time job in the arts and culture industry. I like going to karaoke, playing board games, hanging out with friends (though at home I am a good mix of introvert and extrovert, some days I want to be by myself and other times I can be pretty chatty). I am relatively laid back, but I will uphold my boundaries and will speak my mind if issues arise. I am also a fairly clean person (especially in the kitchen).

2959,A basement bedroom in our home,"We are opening our home to a female student, preferably someone studying in the health professions (medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, etc.). We work at Dalhousie and walk every day. It takes 10 to 15 minutes (depending on campus location). 

The available room is in our basement and is accessible from the main house. The room can be furnished or not, whatever is needed. There is a small fridge downstairs for your use. You would share our kitchen (main floor) and a bathroom (main floor) that is right next to the kitchen. The main floor also includes a dining room and living room. If you are a musician, we have a piano. The upstairs (first floor and above) would not be available to you. Heat and hot water are included in the lease. We may be able to share the internet password (but cannot be responsible for the provider's service).

This is a new idea for us and we would all be learning. We have a nice home of busy people, often it's messy, and many projects are on the go. We envision a situation where you sit with us for family dinners on occasion, and you are mostly busy studying. We have two daughters (11 and 15) with whom you would be sharing a home, and we have one person in the family living with a disability (not looking for help with that, but you would have to feel comfortable around health challenges). We also have two sons (27 and 22), both of whom lived in this same basement room at one point, and have now moved away from home. This listing is for one person only, and ideal for a student who is focused on studying. (Parties could not be held here.)

We have two Siamese cats who know no boundaries, they would definitely demand to be pet and played with. (i.e. you could not have allergies). Our home is at capacity for pets and we could not accept another pet.

There is weekly cleaning of the bedroom and bathroom so the house as a whole stays tidy they get to do their own laundry once a week possibly twice on weekends or after 7 PM the washroom is entirely for them and another student, but there may be times that it’s only for them as we usually do one student at a time. But sometimes we have another student if anything they’ll be sharing only between two people them and one other person we would like to have the household stay quiet at a certain time as I am in my late 40s and my parents are in their 70s. (but honestly my parents are at times younger than I am in attitude lol) my mother Rosa is the person that cooks here and sometimes I pitch in. I live in the basement in my own apartment with my cat. This house does have a cat so you must be OK with it. We like to do a minimum stay of four months and maximum of a year linen will get washed biweekly. No food is allowed in the bedroom as it needs to be eaten in the kitchen. If you have your own food that you would be cooking for dinner, you would be cooking in a separate area of the house that has a toaster oven and an induction plate. we are in Italian Canadian family. My parents immigrated here from Italy from the 60s and I was born here. We like to sit around and talk sometimes. You won’t go hungry in this house and you won’t ever have to worry about hygiene.

The apartment has 2 available bedrooms, one with a queen size bed and one with a twin bed and would be perfect for families to stay for a short time period. The apartment is on the second floor of a mid-century house with a large sunny balcony. It is fully furnished, with bedding, towels, cookware, dishes, and utensils all provided for use. The apartment has a washer/dryer, electric stove, and a dishwasher in the large kitchen. There is a single large bathroom with a shower and bathtub, containing two bathroom sinks and a bidet attachment on the toilet. Heating, electricity, hot and cold water, TV streaming all included in the rental price. High speed internet is $100/month and is charged as the utility fee.

We have some house plants that we hope the tenants could water once a week while they stay. Otherwise, our downstairs neighbor could come by once a week to care for the houseplants. We have a portable AC unit, but the apartment can get hot in the summer. We own a cat who we take with us on our travels, and we keep the place very clean, but our place may not be good for someone with severe cat allergies.

This arrangement would be for short-term stays only, lasting for a few weeks to a couple of months, depending on how long we will be out of town and our place is empty. We will be getting in housecleaners to deep-clean the apartment in between guest stays.

3212,"Bedroom in a two-bedroom condo apartment in Wellington West/Westboro, Ottawa","The condominium is six stories tall and about ten years old. The unit has a shared kitchen and living area, two bedroom, one full bathroom (attached to the rented beroom), and another bedroom with a sink and a toilet. The host will need to access the full bathroom 2-3 times a week in evenings to shower.

The rented bedroom is large and has an attached closet with hangers, but is mostly unfurnished; renter will need to buy bed and bedding. This is because I want to be able to use the room for other things again when I stop renting, and don’t want a bed there permanently. However, to compensate for this, rent is very low. A table and chair for desk space, and a bedside lamp is included. There are pictures and wall hangings in the bedroom, but I can move any of them if you don’t want them or want to put up your own pictures and hangings in place of them.

In the kitchen, we can share kitchenware as well as flour, sugar, spices, cooking oil, etc., and we will get out own shelves for other food in the cupboard and fridge, and each use half the freezer.

There is a balcony - not much use in winter but very nice in summer.

The location is excellent: across the street from a grocery store, with two other grocery stores nearby, and close to transit (across the street from the #11 bus stop, which runs downtown, and a 10-15 minute walk from the Tunney’s Pasture O-Train station.

A little bit more about my husband and I. We got married in March of 2020 and are an active, boisterous and vivacious couple. Though we have good sound proofing in the home, you may hear us laughing together, singing or dancing. We live life and enjoy our community and friends. If you are up for it, we would have you in our space for dinner or games night on occasion. My husband is a hard working, honest, straight shooting kind of guy who loves working on meat smoking projects and cooking. He works in the construction industry and usually is working hard Mon to Fri. I'm generally a smiley, energetic and busy human.

3263,Walk out Suite Queen Bed and Double Closet Bedroom,"Welcome to our fully furnished, legal, 2 bedroom walkout suite at 11142 A. My husband (Jasper) and I (Melissa) occupy the 3 bed, 2 bath upstairs of this generational home. Built in 1991, this home was built by my parents after acquiring it from my maternal grandfather. We completely renovated and turned our basement into a lovely 2 bedroom and 1 bath suite. Renovations were completed end of Nov 2023.

The two bed suite will share the same kitchen, laundry, bathroom and common space. The bedrooms would be your own private space. The suite boasts of a lovely urban view from the kitchen, living room and queen bedroom and lots of natural light. The suite also has it's own private walk out entrance with coded door (no need to worry about keys).

We are about a 10-15 min walk from a park and beach, tennis courts and rail trail. It is also less than a 5 min walk to a bus stop that can take you into Lake Country as well as UBCO. You can transfer from UBCO to get to Kelowna area. It is about a 15 min drive to UBCO by car.

A little bit more about my husband and I. We got married in March of 2020 and are an active, boisterous and vivacious couple. Though we have good sound proofing in the home, you may hear us laughing together, singing or dancing. We live life and enjoy our community and friends. If you are up for it, we would have you in our space for dinner or games night on occasion. My husband is a hard working, honest, straight shooting kind of guy who loves working on meat smoking projects and cooking. He works in the construction industry and usually is working hard Mon to Fri. I'm generally a smiley, energetic and busy human. I have my own contracting business teaching first aid, lifeguarding and swim courses. My schedule varies depending on season. My husband and I love dancing, games, hiking, outdoors, good shows and time with our community.

3485,Clay Studio Suite,"This newly renovated, semi-private daylit basement suite offers a unique living experience on Fabulous Farm, a working farm with pigs, chickens, gardens, and all the lively, natural elements that come with rural life. Expect the occasional noise and dirt from the farm, along with a gravel driveway and plenty of activity. The suite features its own entrance, a fully equipped kitchen with a fridge, freezer, stove, oven, and washer (no dryer). The kitchen and living areas are yours to furnish and use as you like, giving you the feel of a private home.

The suite includes a private bedroom and a beautiful Moroccan Tadelakt-finished bathroom. While the bathroom is primarily yours (90%), it is occasionally shared with clients from the active pottery studio, who access it directly from the back entrance without entering the rest of your space.

Fabulous Farm is a community hub, with six cabins and people frequently coming and going. Two people and two friendly cats live upstairs, and the door between the upstairs and your space is a standard interior door without a lock. While you’ll have all you need for a private life in the suite, expect occasional visits from housemates. You’re also welcome to visit upstairs, socialize, or join the community life.

The suite itself is bright and warm in the winter, thanks to radiant heat in the clay walls and floors. In the summer, it stays naturally cool, providing comfort year-round. For tenants who stay longer, there’s also the opportunity to access garden space on the farm.

If you love a social, rural atmosphere and are looking for a farm life, this space could be perfect for you.",Winlaw,BC,V0G 2J0,,,1,1400.0,0.0,1512.0,,deleted,House,,,,,,,,"['Desk', 'Hangers', 'Closet', 'Drawers', 'Lamp', 'Fridge']",Double bed,"['Fire Extinguisher', 'Smoke Detector']","['Free parking on site', 'Stove and oven', 'Fridge', 'Washer', 'Dryer', 'wifi', 'Window covering', 'Private entry']","['No smoking', 'Quiet hours', 'No shoes inside', 'Keep spaces clean', 'Notice on visitors', 'Scent free']",,,Winlaw
