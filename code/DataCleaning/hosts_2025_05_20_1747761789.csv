We enjoy a good laugh, dancing, being active, community and friendships.  We are pretty open and honest people.  My husband in particular is a ""say it like it is"" type of guy.  We don't do petty drama or gossip.  We believe in building people up and working out issues.

We are not a quiet couple!  We laugh out loud, sing out loud, dance when a good song comes on and can be passionate in discussions.  

We will likely invite you do join us for meals, interactions, games, etc on occasion and you are allowed to say no (with no offence taken) if that's not your thing.

Our home is full of family history.  My (Melissa's) maternal grandfather owned the land we live on and later my parents built this house where I grew up and now my husband and I have made it our own.  We hope you feel welcome, safe and happy renting from us!"

When the kids are at school it's quiet, but when they are home it can be a bit noisy until they go to bed. If you're in your room the noise level is fine I've been told by previous roommates and current ones. We have a roommate who has been with us for 18+ months and would like me to write that he's enjoying his time living with us. He loves our family. :) Very nice of him to say and we love him! We have had many roommates over the years and we usually develop a nice friendship. I feel what makes a healthy roommate situation is respect, good communication, honesty and learning each others boundaries. If you're looking for a loving home, where you will feel safe, then let's chat. If you fit what we are looking for in a roommate then we can proceed with a rental application, criminal record check and verification of job payments. I'm new to using happipad and trying it out. 

I should note that farting is acceptable in our house along with swearing. Everybody does it and we keep it pretty normal in our house without it being awkward. I mean, we aren't rude about it either. Also, my daughter plays piano, my husband plays guitar, and I haven't played in awhile, but I used to play the violin. We love music. 
We also love building and creating. We are working on a little renovation upstairs. My husband and I are quite handy."

My name is Natasha and my partners name is Luke. We live in a spacious basement suite in north vancouver. We would love to provide refuge for anyone affected by the floods in BC. We have 2 lovely cats and 1 puppy. Our cats are very friendly and enjoy lots of cuddles. Our puppy is a chocolate Labrador, so he is quite energetic and loves to play. He is very friendly and loves meeting people. I work with children on the autism spectrum most mornings and in the afternoon I am working from home in study design for a neuroscience lab. My parter is in civil construction and works all day. We both love the outdoors and spend a lot of time hiking on the weekends. On the weekdays we enjoy quiet evenings with homemade dinners. I personally love knitting, reading and listening to podcasts."

I also enjoy reading, cooking or watching a movie curled up on the couch. I am friendly and easygoing, have travelled extensively and made Canada my home 9 years ago after moving here from Germany.

I am currently spending much more time at home than usual as I am dealing with an injury but am normally away for work during the day. While I am very active during the warmer months (hiking, biking, swimming, Yoga, beach etc.), I can be a bit of a homebody in the winter. I strive to live a healthy lifestyle and stay active as much as I can. I work for a health food store chain, so if you have any food or supplement related questions, I will probably be able to answer them :-) 

I am not vaccinated (due to personal reasons), and I do not care if you are. Everybody is welcome in my home as long as they are kind and honest.

Zero-drug tolerance policy in my home, absolutely no vaping, smoking, weed or any other form of drugs. I rarely drink alcohol these days but do not mind if you do.

I should also mention that I cook and eat meat regularly, so if you are a Vegan or strict Vegetarian this is likely not a good fit for you."

With four bedrooms, we considered down-sizing or hosting people.  For the last decade we have had exchange students from several countries that attended High School or Community College (St. Lawrence College).  We have enjoyed being hosts, and using the space in our home more efficiently.
Our exchange students have enjoyed living with us, and we value that.  We want people to be comfortable with us and their living arrangements.  
Other than college students, we have not had adults stay with us, but want to consider having adults when it is a good fit.  As for exchange students, we don't mind doing that, but sometimes the stipend provided isn't sufficient to some of the demands, such as lots of travel because they refuse to use taxi service.
We live about 10 minutes out of Brockville, and don't mind driving people back and forth occasionally.  The neighbourhood is peaceful, good for walks along quiet streets.
Sue and I attend church (now mostly online) but do not want our guests to feel obligated to do so."

The house is located in the Beaches neighborhood of Toronto about 5 mins walk to transit, 5 mins wLk to shops and cafes and about 10 mins walk to the beach and water. It is a wonderfully situated house. I live alone most of the time except for when my boyfriend, his two children age 9 & 11, and 14 year old Puggle stay over, which is every other weekend. The house has 3 floors of living space. The 1st floor is the common area which would be shared. The 2nd floor has 2 bedrooms and a large den/office + a large modern bathroom. The third floor is the attic which is a loft and the master bedroom + another office. I stay in the third floor office most of the time and work from home. I am very quiet and tidy."

I am not a good cook -so please do not expect good home cooked meals unless you cook them :)"

I have a few bad days a month and noise and bright lights are bothersome. I cook, but I’m no chef. I’m not much of a chatter, so no chatty Cathy’s for me. 

On good days I can be bubbly and fun. I enjoy cards or board games. No alcohol or drug issues but don’t want recreational drug use in my home. I take medical cannabis for insomnia and anxiety. I do vape once in a while but only outside. I try to eat healthily. 

Hope we can make this happen."

If our roommate is quiet, we don't mind what time they wake up and go to bed, but we would prefer more quiet during the week.

We are a group of young professionals sharing a large house in lower Glenmore (on walker Dr). We are looking for a fourth person to move in for $975 plus 1/4 utilities. There is no one else on the base floor so you will have your own bathroom and privacy. The view here is incredible and we are looking for someone that enjoys the outdoors as much as possible. Our hobbies: Rose teaches Acro yoga, and gardening. I like to play music (only acoustic in the garage). We both like snowboarding, hiking and camping. Taylor likes to nerd out on his laptop and socialize with us. Let me know if you are interested in learning more and if you could share more about yourself, to see if it's a good match! 
There's a sun room, 2 door garage (w/ chill hang out spot and gym area). Potentially will be using the hot tub this winter."

I am looking to re-assign my lease, as a big opportunity came up for me to leave Kelowna for an extended amount of time.

The house would be shared with 3 young professionals in their late 30's in lower Glenmore(Walker Dr.), including 2 small dogs who are home only half the month. You would have your own patio doors in your room with lots of light. Lots of big communal spaces with great views, a sun room & lots of patio spaces, all with incredible sunsets, a grassy backyard, & a big garage space for storage. Even your own parking spot, if needed.

Riess plays music(only acoustic in the garage), snowboarding, hiking & camping. Taylor likes to nerd out on his computer in his room, and once in a while socialize with us. Hailey, is very creative, artistic, loves gardening & is a handy woman, who owns the 2 dogs. She is on shift work, one week on/off.

Let me know if you are interested in learning more and if you could share more about yourself to see if it's a good match!"

My name is Erika and my husband Stephen and I are looking for a student to join our new home as of October 1st! Details and a little about us below! It is on Falkirk Road, off Hollywood Road in the Rutland area. We have been together over eight years, and are a quiet, working couple (although I am currently on maternity leave until the spring) with an almost five month old daughter. 

Rent is $1000 all included, $500 damage deposit and a one year lease preferred. The place consists of one private bedroom and shared space of the rest of the house. Fresh paint and flooring. One parking spot is available in the driveway, as well as laundry, a covered area outside and a huge backyard. Walking distance to Rutland amenities and a few bus stops. Tons of storage downstairs in the unfinished basement if needed. 

Looking for someone who is quiet, clean, trustworthy, responsible, easy going and friendly like us, as we would prefer someone who we can create a reasonable friendship with if we are sharing the common spaces. LGBTQ friendly, no smoking, no pets, no parties (totally fine with casual drinking, or a boyfriend/girlfriend/occasional friend hanging out). We plan to be here a long time, as we lived in our last place for over seven years. Any other questions, feel free to pm me with a little bit about yourself. Then maybe we can meet up and buy you a coffee and chat!"

We have two grown adult children that visit on occasion.  We live a guiet life so would need a guiet  person. 
We don't smoke and will absolutely not tolerate smoking in the house.  
We drink only occasionally, usually wine with a meal.  We don't want to deal with a person that has alcohol or drug addiction. 
We don't want a person that will be inviting people over to visit. 
We will not tolerate loud noise..
Personal hygiene is important. 

Our house has a downstairs, double bed furnished bedroom available for $700/month.  The bed room is in a walkout ground level basement,  so the room has a large window.  There is a table in front of the window.  It could serve as a desk area too.  
The bedroom has room for a little fridge, the kind you see in hotel rooms.  We don't mind a hotplate and/or microwave use in the bedroom.  The room is relatively large.  
We are in a quiet semi-rural area.  The bedroom has asses to a lower level parking spot and separate downstairs entry.  The downstairs bedroom has a bathroom across the hall.   The laundry room is downstairs and across the hall from the bedroom, but is used only 1-2 x a week by us, the couple in the house. 
The house is relatively quiet, however my husband and I do watch tv in the evenings.  
My son is going to buy the house next summer, so at the present time we cannot guarantee any long term rental.  My son will be renovating the basement when he buys the house in the summer of 2023.  It is his goal to rent out the basement, but wants to renovate it first.  
The basement bedroom might be able to hear us walking around. 
The downstairs bedroom normally has access to a backyard but at the moment the backyard is a mess due to downed trees."

The house is nothing special it's a '70s design and it needs a lot of updates. They take time for me to do on a limited budget. I am a writer and a fan of philosophy ,there is a small TV room ,but no TV in the main large living room where I do most of my writing. There are two scenarios I would be happy with one a match where we don't have a lot of communication but there is respect and we can flow through the days not bothering each other too much. The other of course is someone who has a lot in common and we are able to have a mutual bond that facilitates perhaps a friendship too. There's definitely a swath of people that would find the house to untidy. But it isn't really that bad and I keep the sink pretty clear most of the time. It's reasonable but to people who are highly organized and want more sanitized type setting this would not work. Those who love the outdoors and appreciate the beauty of nature would love it. You're surrounded by large trees and the backyard is terraced, leaving a lovely view from the deck on the bedroom the person would live in. I have two professions in one is a certified dog trainer. I have one dog ,he has a pretty easygoing life as he's getting older. I will always have at least one dog and do welcome someone with a dog, but it has to have the temperament needed. My guy is lovely but old ,and doesn't want too much trouble brought into his life in his old age.
Humour is a foundation of my personality and I am very flexible and easy going. I dont respect fundamentalist christianity or flaky new age stuff like 'The Secret'( which makes me mental).  People tend to like me as I am able to get along with a variety of  personalities.  But.. of course, I'm as flawed as anyone. It really rings true now that I don't like smalltalk. Sometimes its obvious but I try not to be rude."

I am much a homebody, I haven't had any alcohol in 3.5 years- I quit for mental clarity not ever an addiction! I do not smoke. Rarely do I have friends come to the house- children have playdates from time to time. I walk our dog twice a day. He is very mellow and just likes to sleep. He doesn't jump up on anyone or chew aby furniture/items. We eat a variety of food as my children are nit picky and always love tasting new dishes. I bake a couple times a week and we rarely eat out! We have a spare bedroom in our 5 bedroom home, 3 bathrooms, 2 TV rooms, open concept upstairs with a large kitchen!

I am actually a realtor with Royal Lepage. I got a client who wants to build, not far from the Okanagan College Kelowna Campus, about 125 students accommodation.  The location is 12 minutes walk from the college.  Before we embark on such a project, we wanted to consult you:

1.  Is there a huge shortage of accommodation at the Okanagan college to merit building one for 125 students?  We do not want to flood the market.

2. Would you be able to refer some students to our student accommodation perhaps?  If your student accommodation is full of course.  OR would you be interested in running this accommodation for the developer? 

3.  Would you be able to buy the 1.73 acre land and build the accommodation yourself?  Or, if a developer built the accommodation for you, would you be able to buy it or rent it from him?  

This can be a huge business opportunity for you.  

PS:  We also have a piece of land next to the Kelowna General Hospital you can put students accommodation on (For Interns, Medical Students, etc). 

Thanks and regards.

I occasionally drink and smoke vape ( but  I respect everyone's privacy and do not smoke in the building ). I try to think that it’s not just a house but a home, so I must take care of it and leave it the way it was supposed to be when I first arrived.

There is parking for 1 vehicle."

They all live at their home where I also spend some of my time, so when I am home at my own home sweet home I tend to be recharging after work, working on a project or some self-study or writing, and replenishing my inspiration bucket and energy levels. Sometimes I am just ""nothing-ing"" if that's what I feel like. Home is a great space for nothing-ing in an otherwise demanding week. I definitely love some good introverted time, but also love hanging out with people in my life. (Oh by the way, this home has no TV in the living area. Haven't owned one in over a decade, but if you like TV that's an option you could bring along with you 
BUT there IS a bucket of LEGO under the couch for when the kids drop in at my place every once in a while.......so.........). 
Many of my fave people are elsewhere on the globe, and I love to travel and visit when I get the chance.  
I enjoy an occasional concert, a trivia night, a wine tasting or dining out, and love the opportunity to dance to something with some good deep bass in a crowd or group. I extra appreciate spaces where I can dance or enjoy music in a somewhat or entirely sober environment, but will go where the vibe feels good. I do drink socially, but also like to be able to socialize and enjoy culture without that element being present. In the winter season I'm admittedly more of an ""it's cold and dark out there, let's eat something good and huddle under a blanket"" kind of woman (I have NOT adapted to Kelowna winters yet and winter-sports make me shiver just thinking about them - laugh all you want! I was stoked buying my first ever snow shovel when I moved here). I love writing and creating with art materials and always have at least four books semi-on the go, which I eventually finish, or I start another four and pick at them bit by bit. 
I enjoy a cozy space but prefer to invest in experiences over things, so my place is not a curated designer pad. It's an eclectic cozy pad with room for some of your own ""eclectic"" touches too should you feel inspired to add to the cozy."

My Name is Sadhana. I am a mother of two beautiful children. For me hosting is an excellent way to learn about the world without leaving home. Host families, we can learn about different cultures & traditions & get a personal insight into the world beyond their backyards, and even become excellent international cooks. Also, we can share our knowledge & experiences to get to know in deep about another country. Living with a student from another culture is an education in itself."

It is important for us that you can tolerate the company of dogs and is a bonus if you love dogs! We love to eat, and I enjoy cooking and sharing.

I like to be with enthusiastic people who have hobbies. Life is more fun with housemates."

I see this program supporting several goals I have:
1.  Staying socially connected.  I live alone with four cats (not quite the stereotypical crazy cat lady).  I also work from home.  Although I'm an introvert, I know how important it is to have social connections and I want to build more by establish a connection with someone younger.
2.  Helping the environment.  Living in my home, I take up a large carbon footprint and I would feel better if someone else used this space too.
3.  Supporting education.  I have two advanced degrees and I LOVE learning.  Having a student in my home means that I'm creating a stable home for someone who can focus on their education...and I'm hoping that I can learn some new things vicariously through them.  I'd welcome the chance to read papers (and proofread them if wanted). :)
4.  Addressing the housing crisis.  Peterborough rental prices makes housing so challenging for everyone, especially students.  This is my small part in providing shelter to one person.
5.  Creating financial stability.  My work is contract and not guaranteed. I'd like to generate a little more income.  In turn, it would be my pleasure to provide housing at a modest cost to a student so that they can spend their hard-earned money on learning and fun."

I have had many room mates over the years with many different lifestyles and personalities - introverts, extroverts and neurodiverse.  Regardless of our differences, the key to a happy household is mutual respect and clear communication.  Putting things back as you found them helps a lot too.

Currently, an adult male is in one of the upper rooms and my room is downstairs. I have a medium sized dog and my room mate has a bird.

I have minor health issues.  I suppose that could change any moment.","monthly","daily","once_month","I’m 79.  I live alone in a large, 25-year-old house, on 14+ acres, in Oakland.  I’m very close to the river which forms the border between Mahone Bay and Oakland.  I’m closer to the centre of Mahone Bay than many houses which are actually within Mahone Bay town limits.

The house has two distinct areas which could be rented.  One is a suite, on the upper level.  It has a bedroom, a dressing-room and a 3-pc bathroom.  The other, also on the upper level, is a small-to-medium-sized bedroom with a 2-pc bathroom very nearby.

I would rent out only one of these spaces.  The larger space could accommodate a couple.  I’d consider that.  The smaller space is appropriate for one person, only.

I'd allow space in the refrigerator and the freezer.  There is internet and satellite TV.  Laundry facilities would be available but would be restricted to a (scheduled) once-a-week.

I’ve had a dog and two cats, but at this time, I have only one cat.

My home is scent-free.  A renter would have to use unscented laundry products, hand-soap etc, personal products.

At 79, I’m somewhat set in my ways.  A renter would have to pay attention to my “rules” and suggestions.  I don’t want to be a parent nor a trainer.  Been there; done that!  I have five granddaughters ages 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34.  Two have sons.  I’m nuts about my granddaughters and great-grandsons and I think they’d give me a very strong recommendation.  That is; they love me as much as I love them!  And they’ve pushed me into accepting change, sometimes in areas where my son and daughter were surprised observe.

I’m hesitant to consider this whole idea.  But, the alternative is, for me, to soon look for other long-term living arrangements.  So, this is me, sticking my toe in the water to see what it's like!  My 14+ acres might be ideal for a co-living building, but that's another topic altogether.

Your questions, often didn't allow me to express my real feelings.  I think I'd prefer single women, but I'd consider a couple.  I have a granddaughter who's non-binary and would consider a female who self-identifies as non-binary.  There might've been another one or two questions like that, which I struggled answering because none of the options were correct."

I enjoy bringing a smile to people’s faces.  I have an open door philosophy.  This is a big house - meant to be shared with community and friends.  I am a live and let live person.  I do not tolerate alcohol or drug abuse in my home.  Pretty easy going but if you “break the rules” you will be asked to leave.  No notice; no negotiation.  There is a covered sunporch where you can smoke - no smoking in the house.  The house is also a Airbnb.  I have house concerts at least once a month."

About 5 years ago a 40-something University professor (heterosexual female) from Pakistan stayed with us for a few months. That worked out well. 
She had a similar schedule to ours, prepared all of her own food & even prepared a few of her favourite foods from Pakistan to share with us. 
She was very quiet, respectful of or privacy, and had her own transportation. Someone with a similar profile would be the ideal fit for us.  However, we are willing to consider renters with different profiles as well. 
Additionally, this arrangement would have to be financially worthwhile for us to even consider renting."

Let them have fun decorating ginger bread house. Take them to the mall and have our picture taken with Santa Clause. I took them to the movies and also have movie night at home. I live near Britannia Beach, restaurants, walking path which are all walking distance from my home. Teach a bit from my culture and enjoyed introducing them to my cousins in Ottawa. Some I have taken out of town to meet my brothers and my only aunt and cousins. I make sure they have an overall experience in Ottawa is positive and talk with them at dinner. They have come with me to social events with my family as well what Ottawa was offering. I have a rule no cell phones at diner. One of my students was sick and took care of him like is mother by changing his bed while he was taking a shower and checked on him every couple of hours to see he was ok. I enjoyed helping the students with their lunch and we waited for all students to be together for diner and tried to teach them how to cook. I did their laundry. I'm triple vaccinated. I have a car so I am available to drop off and pick up the students should they get lost. I go through with them the bus system and LRT (train) to school. I work with the Federal Government for 33.5 years and work from home permanently. I have a security clearance of Secret. I have a book for students to write something and I have pictures to add. I love my students as if they were my children and keep in touch. Some students want to come back to visit. To date all my students have been a positive experience."

I and my son are pretty quiet and happy at home. He enjoys painting, reading and has protected time to watch TV.  We migrated from London, UK about 4 yrs ago. 

I work shifts as Psychiatric Nurse and Vancouver General Hospital where I provide trauma-informed care (An experience and skills I feel will be relevant to support refugees living in my home)  for patients who struggle with mental health and addiction. I am often home during the day and at night depending on my week of parenting and my work schedule. 

I am generally a kind, caring and empathetic person. I have been described by friends as selfless, generous and a good listener. I am always happy and willing to help other and look for ways to problem solve together.
I think I have the space in my home and in my heart to welcome a refugee, displaced person(s) or an unaccompanied child into my home. As a recently Canadian, I feel this is a way for me to play my part in welcoming refugees and immigrants into Canada. My place will be not only a safe place but a home where all cultures are welcomed and nurtured. 

I am a very resourceful person and will be able to support my guest/roommate with support and services available to help them settle into new home country. 

My house is centrally located at New Westminster Queensborough. The closest bus stop within minutes, and a stop away from 22nd street station (with direct train into Downton Vancouver). There are so many local shops and restaurants walking distance. There is Walmart and an outlet mall within walking distance too.

When did you first join the ODAA?
I first joined the ODDA immediately after l graduated from the dental assistant program at the
Toronto School of Business in 1991. I have assisted over 30 dentists of different backgrounds and have participated in several dental/medical missions to
Guatemala and Haiti.
What is your favourite aspect of
volunteering with the ODAA?
My favourite aspect of volunteering with the ODAA is managing the registration desk at the annual conferences and assisting members with directions around the conference venue.
What advice would you give new dental assistants?
My advice to new dental assistants is to be open-minded, teachable, flexible, and positive. Also, they should avoid office gossip and be team players.
Finally, they should be ambitious and always ready for career advancement.
Who inspires you?
Iam inspired by Dr. Carrie Hui, who is also my current boss. She is professional and humane.
From self-improvement and education to community service at home and abroad, she is a
'doer' who leads by example.
What three words would your best friend use to describe you?
Three words that my best friend uses to describe me are giving, kind, and loyal.
If you won the lottery, what would you do?
If I won the lottery, first I would take care of my family and those who have stuck by me through thick and thin. Second, I would support missions and donate to worthy causes, like Operation Smiles.
Third, I would travel the world.
When you have 30 minutes of free time, what do you like to do?
When I have 30 free minutes, I like to walk and connect with people I haven't spoken to in a
while.
What is the best piece of advice
you've ever received?
The best piece of advice I have ever received is
""not to look at myself through someone else's
eyes.""

As a hobby, and part of my work I have become conversational in a number of different languages as I enjoy meeting and talking with people from all over the world. 
I live in Markham, but I have an investment house in East Toronto I had rented to students. There are still 2 students occupying the 2nd floor, but I am organising the basement and 1st floor for myself to move in, and share with a family in need of housing. This could be temporary as I am looking to re-marry some time, or a long lasting relationship as I would welcome the familiy into my life hopefully with my new wife to be.
The Toronto house is a 2-story detached home in a friendly neighbourhood, only steps from shops, restaurants, parks and subway line, with a little dog who loves people.  
I work free-lance and have lots of time available. I also have a cottage up north which I enjoy working on, and I'm sure the family would have a lot of fun. 
As a bonus, I enjoy teaching music and other subjects.  I became adept at generating lessons for my own son when the schools were shut down during Covid. 
I have 2 extra bedrooms for a family up to 4 or 5 people (beds for 2 adults, 2 kids and small child or toddler)
Thank you by the way, for your great work!  Len"

I am Mark, a 41 year old public servant and musician married to my beautiful wife, Zahra, who is a 42 year old entrepreneur in the health services industry. We have a dashing young son of 2 years of age. He goes to daycare most weekdays and is in bed by 730pm. We are busy and vibrant from 7am-8/830am and then again from 4pm-730pm. Outside of those hours the home is very quiet. We are graduate level educated working professionals and work from home about 3-4 days per week. Both of us go into an office in town 1-2 days per week. 

We love to explore parks and hikes and playgrounds with our little guy on the weekends and have lots of friends and family in town with whom we spend time with. 

We do enjoy traveling and try to go somewhere a few times per year - whether that’s somewhere in BC/Canada or more exotic locations. 

We are a fairly self aware couple and have a loving relationship that we intentionally tend and care for every day. We identify as spiritual and both have roots in various Christian traditions. We are open to hosting anyone that has embraced a lifelong journey of learning and self improvement who can find joy and beauty in the mundane and simple things life has to offer."

To do so, I need to travel throughout Toronto and am also working to gain skills and training that will help me obtain Canadian work experience. At the moment, I am living in a shared basement with five other people, where we share three small rooms, one bathroom, and one kitchen. Each of us pays CAD 500 per month, yet the space is very limited and challenging to maintain in a hygienic and organized way.

There are significant differences in cultural habits and routines; my housemates tend to stay up late, talk over the phone throughout the night, and don't always prioritize cleanliness. I value a quiet and clean environment to get a good night’s rest and to start my day early. Additionally, I am eager to attend workshops and webinars hosted by the City of Toronto and other nonprofits to improve my skills and understand Canadian work culture.

I am in urgent need of a private room where I can study, attend virtual training sessions, and focus on my career development. Without Canadian skills and work experience, I know it will be difficult to secure employment here. I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can provide in helping me find suitable housing where I can continue my efforts to adapt to the culture, customs, and work standards in Canada."

I am 83 years old with Alzheimer's and dementia. Also, I am physically disabled. However, I still maintain my independence because I have a great support system. I am also capable of doing things for myself. I can live alone but living with someone else is necessary because I need help sometimes. And most of all to have someone as a friend and companion. Alzheimer's causes me to forget easily and I repeat myself frequently. It is not that I am crazy, just that my memory is erased as a result of Alzheimer's. With the help of my daughter, Susan, who monitors me and my home closely through cameras, one in the living room and one in the kitchen, I can function daily. The dementia causes me to be confused at times. It is like driving on a foggy night and only seeing a few feet in front of you. It can get scary at times and I feel lost. This is what dementia is like for me. My time is spent mostly watching TV, such as game shows. I like to socialize but because of my illness in the morning I am quieter, so I tend to be more vibrant and energized in the afternoons. I share my stories from long ago because I remember them so well but couldn't tell you what I ate five minutes ago. And yes, repeat the same thing because I have no memories of telling you. I am positive, optimistic, religious, open-minded, empathetic, and happy.  And most of all, I value respect, patience, and understanding, especially towards a classic lady. Overall, I see myself as a pleasant individual who is quiet and peaceful. I am blessed and privileged to be 83 years old. And I am looking forward to meeting you."

She is an 86 year old retired nurse and midwife who was widowed 5 years ago.  My mom is an immigrant from Jamaica, a Seventh Day Adventist (evangelist Christian) and a very sweet and happy person.  We had a housemate move in to the basement in 2020 which has worked out well.  However, he is moving on in April.  My mom has full-time care-givers during the day 7 days a week and lives in a large home (3 levels 5 bedrooms).  We are looking for a student or senior who is interested in sharing a home with my mom, eating meals together a few times a week and doing groceries, going to the mailbox and other errands.  She is generally quite happy to spend a lot of time in her room ( she has a very large room with her own ‘lounge’ area and an ensuite bathroom).  As she has care-givers during the day we are really looking for someone who could be sure to be home at night. The tenant could have the basement floor to themselves - (bedroom, bathroom living room area) or if we all agree - they could have a bedroom on the second floor with their own bathroom.  My mom wears a personal alarm at night in case she falls which we would ask to add the tenant’s cell number to the list of numbers called in the event of a fall.  (She has never triggered the alarm but this is a precaution).  The alarm is also linked to myself and my brother (who lives about half an hour away). The house is bright and airy and includes the use of a home office as well as an outside deck in the summer.  There is a garage and driveway so parking is also possible if the tenant has a car."

I also have liked showing them the beautiful, natural surroundings that we are lucky to be a part of. When at home, I spend my leisure time gardening, puttering around the house, reading and watching a good international film or series."
