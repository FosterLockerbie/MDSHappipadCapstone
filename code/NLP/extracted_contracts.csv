820,View of English Bay from your Queen Sized Bed!,"Fully furnished bedroom with view in the heart of Vancouver's West End/Lost Lagoon. Crazy quiet but within 4 minute walk of shops, restaurants, beach and library! Close to transit, Evo options and 
Stanley Park. My place includes wifi and cable tv, and has laundry in the building and a locked bike-room in the basement. 

You'll share with me only, and have the option of sharing meals (ideal if you don't like cooking, too busy working or studying, or simply prefer to not deal with meal planning and grocery shopping!).  

Looking for an easygoing, tidy roomie. Would be perfect for a student or someone travelling! The perfect roommate would not need to be fastidious about cleaning but be organized and someone that always cleans up after themselves as I am the same way.

At this time am preferring a roomie that will stay until February 2022 at least, possibly until the end of the school year. Feel free to reach out though and we can discuss.

Please note:
If you have a vehicle you will need to purchase a West End parking pass in order to park in the area. I do not have a parking spot within the building unfortunately.

My husband and I are a newly married couple in our early 30s.  My husband works for Kelowna Ready Mix as a concrete mixer driver and crane operator and I contract work and study at Okanagan College.  We enjoy the outdoors and community.  Our home typically has some kind of company over at least once a week at the moment enjoying games, my husbands cooking or just visiting.

Roommates will be responsible to helping clean the shared space.

My husband (Jasper) and I (Melissa) occupy the 3 bed, 2 bath upstairs of this generational home. Built in 1991, this home was built by my parents after acquiring it from my maternal grandfather. We completely renovated and turned our basement into a lovely 2 bedroom and 1 bath suite. Renovations were completed end of Nov 2023.

The two bed suite will share the same kitchen, laundry, bathroom and common space. The bedrooms would be your own private space. The suite boasts of a lovely urban view from the kitchen, living room and queen bedroom and lots of natural light. The suite also has it's own private walk out entrance with coded door (no need to worry about keys).

We are about a 10-15 min walk from a park and beach, tennis courts and rail trail. It is also less than a 5 min walk to a bus stop that can take you into Lake Country as well as UBCO. You can transfer from UBCO to get to Kelowna area. It is about a 15 min drive to UBCO by car.

A little bit more about my husband and I. We got married in March of 2020 and are an active, boisterous and vivacious couple. Though we have good sound proofing in the home, you may hear us laughing together, singing or dancing. We live life and enjoy our community and friends. If you are up for it, we would have you in our space for dinner or games night on occasion. My husband is a hard working, honest, straight shooting kind of guy who loves working on meat smoking projects and cooking. He works in the construction industry and usually is working hard Mon to Fri. I'm generally a smiley, energetic and busy human. I have my own contracting business teaching first aid, lifeguarding and swim courses. My schedule varies depending on season. My husband and I love dancing, games, hiking, outdoors, good shows and time with our community. We hope you feel welcome and safe in our home.","Walk out Suite Queen Bed and Double Closet Bedroom.
