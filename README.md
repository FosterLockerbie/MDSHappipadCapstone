### Project Details

This project contains the capstone project completed by the aforementioned authors in May - June, 2025. Files are included for Happipad staff to run the dashboards created, and the predictive modeling. There is one folder for each of these categories within this respository. 

To run the dashboards or predictive modeling, the CSV file with the datasets in the same format as was provided for this project must be included in the same folder before running the files. Each code file is notated to provide further context.

The final report of this project is also included in the repository, which provides details on our research questions, methodology, and results.
